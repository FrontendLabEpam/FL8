#The separation of concerns
The separation of technologies is an incredibly good idea but it was not always implemented in real life products.
.columns[.col-50[
  ![The separation of concerns, old](assets/img/the-separation-of-concerns-old.png)
  .small[The separation of technologies: HTML is the structure, CSS is for the visual look and feel and JavaScript is for behaviour.]
].col-50[
  ![The separation of concerns, new](assets/img/the-separation-of-concerns-new.png)
  .small[Think of the "separation of concerns" and not layers of development.]
]]

<br>
After each new web technology is introduced the separation becomes much harder. What good is a CANVAS without any scripting? Should we animate in CSS or in JavaScript? Is animation behaviour or presentation? Should elements needed solely for visual effects be in the HTML or generated with JavaScript or with :after and :before in CSS?

#Maintainable code

You don’t write clean markup for the browser, you don’t write it for the end users. You write it for the person who takes over the job from you. Much like you should use good grammar.

#Why to use css organizing methodologies?

There is no "one true way" to write CSS but there are techniques that can keep CSS more organized and more structured, leading to code that is easier to build and easier to maintain.

.img-wrap-70[![Code organizing](assets/img/code-organizing.jpg)]


No matter what methodology you choose to use in your projects, you will benefit from the advantages of more structured CSS and UI. Some styles are less strict and more flexible, while others are easier to understand and adapt in a team.

# SMACSS

.columns[.col-50[

  A flexible guide to developing sites small and large. Is more style guide than rigid framework.
  At the very core of SMACSS is categorization. By categorizing CSS rules, we begin to see patterns and can define better practices around each of these patterns.

  There are five types of categories:

  - Base
  - Layout
  - Module
  - State
  - Theme

# SMACSS

.columns[.col-60[

  **Base** rules are the defaults. They are almost exclusively single element selectors, attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors, child selectors or sibling selectors.

  **Layout** rules divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or more modules together.

  **Modules** are the reusable, modular parts of our design. They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on.

  **State** rules are ways to describe how our modules or layouts will look when in a particular state.

  **Theme** rules are similar to state rules in that they describe how modules or layouts might look.

      <a href="#" class="button is-disabled">Hide</a>
    </article>
  </section>
</aside>
```

##Project structure (using SCSS)

Every project needs some organization.
Much of the purpose of categorizing things is to codify patterns—things that repeat themselves within our design. Repetition results in less code, easier maintenance, and greater consistency in the user experience. Exceptions to the rule can be advantageous but they should be justified.



.columns[.col-40[
``` css
@import 'setting';
@import 'mixin';

@import 'base';

@import 'layout/grid';
@import 'layout/alternate';

@import 'module/btn';
@import 'module/profile';
@import 'module/nav';
```
].col-60[

#BEM


BEM stands for “Block”, “Element”, “Modifier”. It is a front-end methodology: a new way of thinking when developing Web interfaces.

###Block
A block is an independent entity, a “building block” of an application. A block can be either simple or compound (containing other blocks).

###Element
An element is a part of a block that performs a certain function. Elements are context-dependent: they only make sense in the context of the block that they belong to.

###Modifier
An entity that defines the appearance, state, or behavior of a block or element.

``` css

  .site-header { ... } /* block */
  .site-header__logo { ... } /* element */
  .site-header__logo—xmas { ... } /* modifier */
  .site-header__navigation { ... } /* element */

```

#Atomic design

A methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems:
Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, Pages. 
Atomic elements combine together to form molecules which can combine further to form relatively complex organisms.
